**Hyper 3 is finally out!** The primary focus for this
release is **performance**.

The latest version includes several enhancements that make Hyper
_really_ fast. For those of us who spend a significant amount
of time on the command line, this release is a total game changer.

[Download Hyper 3](/#installation) to try it out, and read on to learn more about
what's new.

## Getting There

Looking back on this release, a pleasant surprise has been how little
time it took from _"let's make this thing faster"_ to
_"Holy shell! That's fast!"_

Below, we visit some of the important changes that were shipped as
part of this release:

## WebGL Renderer

The renderer is the piece of code that draws actual pixels on the
screen based on the state of the terminal. The original Hyper renderer
was based on the DOM. While that was a flexible approach thanks to
CSS, it was also very slow.

Hyper 2 improved upon this by switching from `hterm` to
`xterm.js` and using its canvas-based renderer. While that
made Hyper 2 faster, for Hyper 3 we knew it was possible to deliver
even faster performance by completely rewriting the renderer with [WebGL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API). By fortunate coincidence, as we were still figuring things out, [Daniel Imms](https://github.com/tyriar) (from
`xterm.js` and `VSCode` fame),
[just returned from a "vacation"](https://twitter.com/Tyriar/status/1064932797016489984)
where he happened to be write a shiny new WebGL renderer.

Isn't the open source community just amazing? We immediately merged
Daniel's branch onto a test fork, and well, it ran circles around
Hyper 2. Thanks [Daniel](https://twitter.com/Tyriar)!

We are aware of a few minor limitations with using this renderer (e.g
selection is always black-and-white, and you can't have more than 16
terminals visible simultaneously) but the performance benefits
outweigh them. The new renderer is still work-in-progress, so you can
expect further improvements in the near future.

## IPC Batching

We also discovered that commands that were very verbose would cause
Hyper to temporarily choke for a few seconds. For example, running
`find ~` would cause Hyper to:

- Run painfully slow for ~5 seconds (at ~1 frame-per-second)
- Suddenly get faster (at ~15 frames-per-second) and finish printing
  everything in ~10 seconds.

Digging within the CPU profile, we noticed that the "renderer" process
was spending most of its time handling an overwhelming amount of
messages coming in from the main process.

It is easy to see the difference between Hyper v2 and v3.
The pink segments represent the time spent in processing IPC, instead of parsing or rendering.

Electron uses a multi-process architecture where each window runs on
its own separate "renderer" process. Additionally, there's one
Node.js-based "main" process that communicates directly with the
underlying OS. In order for terminal data to be rendered by Hyper, it
must be passed from the main process to the renderer process using IPC
(Inter-Process Communication).

**Node's IPC, unfortunately, comes with a non-trivial amount of
overhead.**
Messages are sent back and forth as **JSON strings**,
which must be encoded on one side and decoded on the other. Also,
receiving data through IPC is an async operation, and thus queued in
V8's event loop. Yielding back to the event loop each time after
processing small messages makes matters further worse. This repeated
IPC caused thrashing when processing bursts of text (like running
`cat` on a large file).

To mitigate this problem, we came up with a simple solution:
**batch data into larger chunks before sending them to the renderer
process**. IPC batching reduces the number of messages for verbose commands
significantly and allows the renderer to focus on, well, rendering.

One important consideration was to
**batch as much data as possible to reduce the IPC overhead, but not
so much that we introduce perceivable latency**. With this approach, the renderer process now spends most of its time
doing terminal emulation and rendering instead of processing IPC
messages. The outcome is a much smoother, and faster terminal.

On a similar vein, we are also testing a new approach to
[decide how much data is parsed](https://github.com/zeit/xterm.js/pull/4/files)
before yielding to the renderer. The idea is to prevent skipped frames
for a more responsive terminal.

## Electron V3

Hyper 3 bumps the underlying Electron from V1 to V3. We also tested
V4, but a [regression in the Canvas API](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=683994#c35)
forced us to stay on V3. The upgrade brings in newer versions of V8
and Node.js, and their corresponding bug fixes.

## Faster Startup Time

Hyper 3 improves startup time by creating the first
_pseudoterminal (pty)_ as soon as possible. A pty is a facility
provided by operating systems to allow programs such as Hyper to
emulate terminals.

In previous versions, Hyper would wait for the Chromium window to
open, send an "I'm ready" message, and _only then_ create the
pty. Those two activities take a substantial amount of time, but could
be done in parallel.

Hyper 3 starts initializing both at the same time. By the time the
window says "I'm ready", the pty is already warmed-up and ready to be
consumed. This gives Hyper 3 a decent boost in launch time (about
150ms on Linux, potentially better on other platforms).

## Emoji Support

If you're on MacOS, you can now press
`Command + Control + Space` to get an emoji popup and [jazz up those commit messages](https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me/).

## More Themes on Hyper Store

Since Hyper 2, we have added many new themes into the [Hyper Store](https://hyper.is/themes?newest). This means
it's now even easier to customise your Hyper experience to your
personality.

We have a detailed contribution page that explains how you can go
about [enlisting your extension](https://github.com/zeit/hyper-site/wiki/Submitting-a-new-plugin-or-theme-to-Hyper-Store). We encourage all contribution and look forward to adding more themes
and plugins from the community!

## The Road Ahead

Terminals have existed since the 60s, and have been a powerful tool in
our workflows. Their flexibility guarantees that they will remain
relevant for years to come. [We're in for the long haul](https://twitter.com/rauchg/status/1074381303506587650).

Hyper is a new kind of terminal, built on top of web technology, with
a focus on extensibility. This opens new possibilities that can make
the CLI experience [more productive](https://github.com/chabou/hyper-pane) (and [fun](https://github.com/Aaronius/hyper-cat))!

We're excited to keep improving Hyper, both in terms of performance
and capabilities — there's a lot to do. Hyper is completely open
source, and we welcome your [involvement and contribution](https://github.com/zeit/hyper).

## Acknowledgments

We're genuinely thankful to the open source community. We're not
saying this only because we are building on top of an incredible set
of open source libraries, but also because we find the helpful ethos
of the community very touching.

As soon as the [`xterm.js`](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/)
team heard we were working on performance, they jumped right in and
helped us with feedback and several initiatives they had on their
side. We would like to extend huge thanks to [Daniel Imms](https://github.com/tyriar), [@Jerch](https://github.com/jerch) and [Benjamin Staneck](https://github.com/stanzilla) for their
contribution and feedback.
